    Select the top 3 videos to learn about Principal Component Analysis from the options provided in the Json below.
    Use the "name", "url", "sentimentScore" attributes of each video to determine which three are the best ones.

    If presented to an unknown user, there should be a video for everyone, from beginner to advanced.
    So keep in mind to not only select beginner or only videos that cover advanced topics.
    
    Additionally, DO NOT return multiple videos with the same "name" or "url", return a set of 3 unique videos.

    Return a Json with the same structure as the provided one below, containing your top 3 videos, starting with the best one.
    Return the modified  json and the modified json only!!!

    VERIFY THAT IT IS VALID JSON!!!
