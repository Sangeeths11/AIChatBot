that  quest  is  the  best  if  you  don't 
 think  so  then  we  have  different  opinions 
 hello  I'm  Josh  stommer 
 and  welcome  to  stat  quest  today  we're 
 gonna  be  talking  about  the  main  ideas 
 behind  principle  component  analysis  and 
 we're  going  to  cover  those  concepts  in 
 five  minutes  if  you  want  more  details 
 than  you  get  here  be  sure  to  check  out 
 my  other  PCA  video 
 let's  say  we  had  some  normal  cells 
 if  you're  not  a  biologist  imagine  that 
 these  could  be  people  or  cars  or  cities 
 or  etc  they  could  be  anything  even 
 though  they  look  the  same  we  suspect 
 that  there  are  differences  these  might 
 be  one  type  of  cell  or  one  type  of 
 person  or  car  or  city  etc  these  might  be 
 another  type  of  cell  and  lastly  these 
 might  be  a  third  type  of  cell 
 unfortunately  we  can't  observe 
 differences  from  the  outside  so  we 
 sequence  the  messenger  RNA  in  each  cell 
 to  identify  which  genes  are  active  this 
 tells  us  what  the  cell  is  doing  if  they 
 were  people  we  could  measure  their 
 weight  blood  pressure  reading  level  etc 
 okay  here's  the  data 
 each  column  shows  how  much  each  gene  is 
 transcribed  in  each  cell  for  now  let's 
 imagine  there  are  only  two  cells  if  we 
 just  have  two  cells  then  we  can  plot  the 
 measurements  for  each  gene  this  gene 
 gene  one  is  highly  transcribed  in  cell 
 one  and  lowly  transcribed  in  cell  two 
 and  this  gene  gene  9  is  lowly 
 transcribed  in  cell  1  and  highly 
 transcribed  in  cell  2 
 in  general  cell  one  and  cell  to  have  an 
 inverse  correlation  this  means  that  they 
 are  probably  two  different  types  of 
 cells  since  they  are  using  different 
 genes 
 now  let's  imagine  there  are  three  cells 
 we've  already  seen  how  we  can  plot  the 
 first  two  cells  to  see  how  closely  they 
 are  related  now  we  can  also  compare  cell 
 one  to  sell  three  cell  one  and  cell 
 three  are  positively  correlated 
 suggesting  they  are  doing  similar  things 
 lastly  we  can  also  compare  cell  two  to 
 cell  three  the  negative  correlation 
 suggests  that  cell  two  is  doing 
 something  different  from  cell  3 
 alternatively  we  could  try  to  plot  all 
 three  cells  at  once  on  a  three 
 dimensional  graph  cell  one  could  be  the 
 vertical  axis  cell  two  could  be  the 
 horizontal  axis 
 and  sell  three  could  be  depth  we  could 
 then  rotate  this  graph  around  to  see  how 
 the  cells  are  related  to  each  other  but 
 what  do  we  do  when  we  have  four  or  more 
 cells  draw  tons  and  tons  of  to  sell 
 plots  and  try  to  make  sense  of  them  all 
 or  draw  some  crazy  graph  that  has  an 
 axis  for  each  cell  and  makes  our  brain 
 explode 
 no  both  of  those  options  are  just  plain 
 silly 
 instead  we  draw  a  principal  component 
 analysis  or  PCA  plot 
 a  PCA  plot  converts  the  correlations  or 
 lack  thereof  among  the  cells  into  a  2d 
 graph 
 cells  that  are  highly  correlated  cluster 
 together  this  cluster  of  cells  are 
 highly  correlated  with  each  other 
 so  are  these  and  so  are  these  to  make 
 the  clusters  easier  to  see  we  can 
 color-code  them  once  we've  identified 
 the  clusters  in  the  PCA  plot  we  can  go 
 back  to  the  original  cells  and  see  that 
 they  represent  three  different  types  of 
 cells  doing  three  different  types  of 
 things  with  their  genes  BAM 
 here's  one  last  main  idea  about  how  to 
 interpret  PCA  plots  the  axes  are  ranked 
 in  order  of  importance 
 differences  among  the  first  principal 
 component  access  PC  one  are  more 
 important  than  differences  along  the 
 second  principal  component  access  PC  two 
 if  the  plot  looked  like  this 
 where  the  distance  between  these  two 
 clusters 
 is  about  the  same  as  the  distance 
 between  these  two  clusters 
 then  these  two  clusters  are  more 
 different  from  each  other  than  these  two 
 clusters  before  we  go  you  should  know 
 that  PCA  is  just  one  way  to  make  sense 
 of  this  type  of  data  there  are  lots  of 
 other  methods  that  are  variations  on 
 this  theme  of  dimension  reduction  these 
 methods  include  heat  maps  tea  Snee  plots 
 and  multiple  dimension  scaling  plots  the 
 good  news  is  that  I've  got  stat  quests 
 for  all  of  these  so  you  can  check  those 
 out  if  you  want  to  learn  more  note  if 
 the  concept  of  dimension  reduction  is 
 freaking  you  out  check  out  the  original 
 stat  quest  on  PCA  I  take  it  nice  and 
 slow  so  it's  clearly  explained  hooray 
 we've  made  it  to  the  end  of  another 
 exciting  stat  quest  if  you  like  the  stat
